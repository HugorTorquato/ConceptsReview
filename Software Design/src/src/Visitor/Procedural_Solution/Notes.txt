-> Note that this addition would have an impact not only on the switch
    statement in the
    drawAllShapes() function (it is now truly incomplete),
    but also on all classes derived from
    Shape (Circle and Square). These
    classes depend on the enumeration since they
    depend on the Shape base
    class and also use the enumeration directly. Therefore, changing
    the
    enumeration would result in a recompilation of all your source files.

    That should strike you as a serious issue. And it is indeed. The heart of the
    problem is
    the direct dependency of all shape classes and functions on the
    enumeration. Any change to
    the enumeration results in a ripple effect that
    requires the dependent files to be
    recompiled.

    I would
    assume that
    in a larger codebase, this is not the only
    statement. On
    switch
    the contrary, there will be
    others that need to be updated as well

-> This kind of type-based programming has a long history in C, and one of
    the things we know
    about it is that it yields programs that are essentially
    unmaintainable.

-> Addition of operations is essy
   Addition of (polymorphic) types is hard ( requires to compile everything )
